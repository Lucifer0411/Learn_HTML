Inheritance in CSS
==================
Like any object oriented language, css follows the concept of inheritance.
In simple words it means that we are having a parent element and child element.
For example consider the following html code: -
    <div>
        <p>
            ......
            <a>........</a>
        </p>
    </div>
For browser this html code will get converted into an inheritance tree as shown below: -
                    <div>
                     /
                   <p>
                   /
                  <a>
    In the above code <div> is parent of <p> and <p> is parent of <a>
    so, if we apply a css property like color on <div> it will 
    also effect color of <p> and <a>
    and this is inheritance.

Css:     <style>
            h1{
             color:red;             //inherit
             font-size:20px;        //inherit
             border: solid 20px blue;       //not inherit
             }
        </style>
    html:   <body>
                <h1> This is a <em> test </em> </h1>
            </body>

The "inherit" keyword
======================
CSS provides as a keyword called inherit which forces the browser to inherit parent
parent properties into child element for example the code shown below will add border with
same effect on <em> as on <h1>
    css:    <style>
        h1{
            color:red;
            font-size: 20px;
            border:2px solid blue;
        }
        em{
            border: inherit;
        }
    </style>
    //background-color is a transparent initially


CSS Units
=========
Just like in real world we have methamatical units like km, gram etc similarly in css
also measure the elements
A css unit decide how large or small an element will appear.
    example :   
        p{
            margin:20px ;
        }
        //p: selector
        //margin: property
        //20: value
        //px: unit

Types of units in css
=====================
Css provide two categories of units: -
1.  absolute
2.  relative

Absolute: -Absolute units are those which do not change even if browser settings or
            view port(device) changes.
            Example of absolute units are:-
    px, pt, pc, cm, mm, in 
    Example: -
    css:    <style>
                    p{
                        font-size:20pt;
                    }
            </style>

    html:       <body>
                        <span>hello</span>
                        <p>
                            welcome user <br>
                            <a href="www.facebook.com" >visit facebook</a>
                        </p>
                </body>

According to the above ruleset font size of para and anchor will remain fixed at 20pt
So, even if default settings of the browser are change still para and anchor will appear
in 20pt.
