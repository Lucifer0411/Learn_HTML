background-position
--------------------
    what is % % in background-position?
    ------------------------------------
    If we set the background-position as 
    background-position:75% 25% then it does not mean the image will be shifted 75% from left
    and 25% from top. Rather it means the 75% 25% spot (left top) on image will collide/
    overlap/co-inside with 75% 25% spot of the container.
    Thus, if we say background-position:50% 50% 
    then it means that the spot at 50% left and 50% top on the image will collide with 
    containers 50% left and 50% top in other word image will be center align in the 
    container.

background-attachment
======================
Bydefault a background image scrolls with the page. However to controll this scrolling and 
set the image at a fixed position we use background-attachment:-
    possible values are:
        scroll (default), fixed ,inherit.
        Example:    background-attachment:fixed;

background-size
================
Bydefault images take the same size as their original dimention but we can change
this behaviour by using background-size.
Its possible values are:
        1. auto(default)
        2. cover/contain= straching the image.
        3. width,height= programmer given width height.
        4. width= width given by programmer height calculated automatically.
cover/contain
Cover strach the image to fill up the entire container area.
On the other hand contain make sure that image falls inside the container, straches it
but does not gurantee to cover full area.
    background-size:cover;

background
==========
All the previous properties can be set using a single property called background
However it is not compulsary to mention value for every property because browser will take
their default values if we skipped them.
