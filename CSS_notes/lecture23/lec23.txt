4. Class selector

Universal Selector
==================
1.  The univeral selector is used to apply styling to every element present on the
    page that is <p>, <a>, <table> etc
2.  The general syntax of applying a universal selector is:-
        *{
            //CSS properties
        }
        where * indicates universal selector
    example: *{
            font-family:Ariel;
            font-size:20px;
            font-weight:normal;
            }
Type Selector
=============
1.  Type selector is applyed on HTML elements based upon their names
2.  It is also called element selector and its general syntax is: -
        tag{
            .....
            .....
        }
        where tag is the name of html element without angular braces
    example:  
      body{
                font-style: italic;
                }
    example:  
        *{
            color: red;
        }
        p{
            font-weight: bold;
        }
        h1{
            color: green;
            border: dashed blue 2px;
        }

ID Selector
===========
1.  The ID selector is used to uniquely identify an html element.
2.  We generally use id when we want to apply some rule set on just one element.
    general syntax:
        css:    #somename{
                            .......
                        }
        html:   <tag id="somename">
                ......
                </tag>
                where # is symbol to indicate id
    example:
            p{
                font-weight: bold;
                font-size: 20px;
                color:blue;
            }
            #intro{
                font-style: italic;
                color: red;
                font-weight: normal;
            }     

        <p id="intro">This is a italic</p>
        <p>This text is not italic</p>
--Id's must be unique no two html elements should have same id.
    If we keep id same for two elements then css will work perfectly but js and react will 
    face problems.

Class Selector
==============
1.  Class selector is used when we want to apply some common rule set on more than one
    element but not on every element.
2   To create a class selector.
        syntax:   
        CSS:    .somename{
                        ........
                    }

        html:   <tag class="somename">
                    .........   
                </tag>
            where . indicate class selector
    example:    
            .highlight{
                    font-weight: bold;
                    color: red;
            }
            h1{
                color:#fff00;
            }
            <h1>Good Morining</h1>
            <p> This is normal text in black color</p>
            <p class="highlight"> But this is red and black</p>
            <a class="highlight" href="http://www.yahoo.com">
            Link to yahoo in red and black</a>
    
   
Applying more than one class on same element:-
==============================================
We are allowed to add multiple classes on same html element but to do this we 
need to provide spaces between class names
If the two classes applied will have common properties than the class created later
will replace the previous one.
For example in the code shown below the text color of para will be blueviolet and not red
 example:
          .highlight{
                    font-weight: bold;
                    color: red;
            }
            h1{
                color:#fff00;
            }
            .thicky{
                border: 2px green dotted;
                color: blueviolet;
            }
            <h1>Good Morining</h1>
            <p> This is normal text in black color</p>
            <p class="highlight thicky"> But this is red and black</p>
            <a class="highlight" href="http://www.yahoo.com">
            Link to yahoo in red and black</a>

Id vs class
============
         id                                                class
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         
1.Used for identifying one           |  1.Used for creating group of elements which
element uniquely                     |       will be applied common styling
                                     |   
2.Id's in the entire page must be    |  2.Multiple elements can have same class
unique.                              |
                                     |     
3.One element can be allocate one id |  3.One class can be allocate to multiple element
and one id can be allocate to one id |   and element can also have multiple classes.
                                     |
4.Has greater specificity than class |  4.Has lower specificity than id
