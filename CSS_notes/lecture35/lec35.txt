Creating Zebra strips
======================
1.  Zibra strips means applying background color to alternate rows
2.  This can be done easily by applying css pseudo class called :nthchild()
3.  We can pass 3 types of value to nth child and they can be 
        a)CSS keywords like: even or odd
        b)An integer indicating exect row number(row number in css begins from 1)
        c)Using the expression "An + B"
            where A and B are integers and n is a count which begins from 0
    Example 1:
            tr:nth-child(odd){
                background-color:darkgray;
            }
     Sets the background color of every odd number row to dark gray

    Example 2:
            tr:nth-child(even){
                background-color:darkgray;
            }
     Sets the background color of every even number row to dark gray

    Example 3:
            tr:nth-child(1){
                background-color:darkgray;
            }
            tr:nth-child(4){
                background-color:lightgray;
            }
    Set the background color of row number 1 darkgray and row number 4 to lightgray

    Example 4:
            tr:nth-child(2n+3){
                background-color:darkgray;
            }
    Sets the background color of every odd numbered row starting from three to darkgray

    Example 5:
            tr:nth-child(2n+2){
                background-color:darkgray;
            }
            Sets the background color of every even number of row to darkgray

Divs and Span
=============
Div
---
1.  Div stand for division and we use it for dividing our webpage into multiple sections
2.  Div is most popularly used when we want to group multiple elements and treat them as a single black
3.  Divs are same as para but most important difference is that a div can contain any kind of data like 
    text, images, table, links, heading etc while a para can only contain textual data
4.  Divs in modern web development have replaced table for layouting purpose and then load faster compare
    to tables. Also we can customize the div using css
    Syntax:
            <div>
                ...content....
            </div>
Span
----
1.  A span is also a container tag like div but generally used for wrapping smaller sections of the webpage
2.  Another point which differce a span from div is that div is a block level element while span is
    a inline element
    syntax:
            <span>
                    ....content....
            </span>
