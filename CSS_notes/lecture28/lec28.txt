Handling fonts in css
======================
1.  Fonts are very important feature for making a website look friendly and beautiful
2.  Although to a certain level font handling can be done using html but it is not at all recommended
3.  The best way to deal with fonts is to use CSS.
4.  CSS provides as 5 properties for font handling and they are:
        a.  font-family: allow us to set name of the font default is times new roman
        b.  font-style: allows us to choose wheater font will be normal or italics
        c.  font-weight: allows us to set darkness that is boldness of the font
        d.  font-size: allows us to set font size, both relative and absolute
        e.  font-variant: a new property added in css and allows us to generate capital letters
            in the size of small letters.

Font Family:
1.  The font-family property allows us to decide what font to be used on the page
2.  There are three ways to set font-family and they are:-  
        1.  exect font name
            example: p{
                font-family:arial;
            }
        2.  mentioning font group name
            example: p{
                font-family:sans-serif;
            }
        3.  Using fallback
            example: p{
                font-family:arial,verdana,sans-serif;
            }

What are font-familes/font groups
=================================
According to web development on the internet there are 5 categories of fonts :
1.  Serif fonts: Serif is a french word and it means a font with decoration or strokes.
    Examples are: time new roman, geogia etc
2.  Sans-Serif font: In french sans no so a sans-serif font is font without any decorations 
    Examples are: arial, verdana etc
3.  Monospace fonts: These are fonts where every letter has same horizontal width
    Examples are: consolas, courie, courie new etc
4.  Cursive fonts: These are font which ressemble cursive hand writing
    Examples are:comic sans ms, french script MT,etc
5.  Fantasy fonts: These are fonts used for advertisements which make characters appear wider and darker
    Examples are:stencil,impact, etc

Web safe fonts
===============
1.  Web safe fonts are those which are commonly found on every popular operating system.
2.  Examples are: time new roman,arial etc
3.  So, as a development we must either 
    a.  Choose a web safe font or
    b.  Use a very popular font liberary called google fonts

In css what is @import
======================
It is a css directive which informs the browser to download and connect a particular font liberary with
our current css file 
We generally use it for linking and associating liberary like google font or squirrel in our web page.
@import is always used in .css file and not in .html file

font-style
==========
1.  Allows us to set font as italic, normal, or oblique 
2.  normal is regular form while oblique is a font which is produced by the browser by tilting normal
    font towards right
3.  Italic in itself is a font which ressemble cursive writing

    In most of the browser oblique and italic will appear to be same so its prefered to go for italics
    in case we want to emphasis some text.

    Examples: 
                p.normal{
                    font-style:normal;
                }
                p.italic{
                    font-style:italic;
                }
                p.oblique{
                    font-style:oblique;
                }
                p. means select those paragraph whose class attribute is set to be given

        <p class="normal">This is nomrmal font</p>
        <p class="italic">This is italic font</p>
        <p class="oblique">This is oblique font</p>
