Types of CSS
============

When is internal css is used?
============================
a.  When we just have one HTML page.
b.  When we have multiple pages but for every pages we want different styling.

External CSS: -
===============
a.  External CSS is the most popular form of css and very commonly used by web developers
b.  It is a two step process: -
    1.  We create a seprate css file containing all the css code
        p{
            text-align:center;
            font-weight:bold;
            font-style:italic;
            font-size:30px;
            border:2px dashed green;
            color:crimson;
        }
    2.  Assuming that we have saved this file by the name "mystyles.css" in a folder
        at root called "cssfiles" we used <link> tag in HTML to connect html page with
        it.
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/cssfiles/mystyles.css"/>
        <body>
            <p> hello world!</p>
            <p> This paragraph is styled by css</p>
            </body>
c.  Most of the time it is recommended to use external style sheet only.

Inline CSS
===========
In this we add css code directly inside the <html> tag using an attribute called style
    <tag style="css code">...........</tag>
    <p style="font-size:40px">This paragraph is style with css</p>

1.  We should try to avoid inline css because it mixes HTML and CSS which makes it 
    difficult for us to understand the code.
2.  However, we can use it if the entire page for some element we want different styling

Selectors in css

CSS is all about applying styling on our webpage. But we need to identify on which html
element the styling needs to be applyed. This identification is called selector. So 
selectors are mechanism to pickup html element for styling.
In css there are many ways of selectors but top four are:-
    1.  Univeral Selectors
    2.  Type selector or element selector
    3.  Id selector
    4.  class selector
