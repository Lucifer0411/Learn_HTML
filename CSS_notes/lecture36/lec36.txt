Semantic tags in html
=====================
1.  The word semantic elements in html indicates those tags whose names are meaningful.
2.  We already know some semantic tags like : <h1>, <img>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <table>.
3.  However, html5 has provided some more meaningful tags which are alternates to <div> but they have more 
    meaningful names.

Why to use semantic tags when we already have <div> ?
=======================================================
1.  If a page uses semantic tags it becomes more readable.
2.  Semantic tags are SEO friendly as well as can be easily understood by screen readers.
3.  They make our css and html code look consistent 

Popular alternates of <div>
=============================
    <header>
    <nav>
    <main>
    <article>
    <section>
    <aside>
    <footer>

1.  <header>: Defines the banner of the website. That is introductory information.
2.  <nav>: Use to generate navigation menu.
3.  <main>: Contains the actual content of the website. One webpage should have one <main> tag.
4.  <article> and <section>: <article> tags contains self discriptive content and can be further divided into 
        multiple <section>. However the above rule can be reverse also. That is a <section> can also contains
        <article>.
5.  <aside>: Contents less relevant information like side bar.
6.  <footer>: Contains footer information like copyright or website development information etc.

Box model
=========
Every element displayed on the webpage is comprissed of rectangular boxes. The box model in css describes
    how these boxes will be laid down box model mainly deals with core element are:
    1. content: It can be text, image anything that we want to add in the webpage.
    2. padding: This is the inner space betweeen content and the border.
    3. border: This is the frame which is bydefault invisible and covers rectangular portion around an element.
    4. margin: This is the outer space between frame and next item.

Width and height
================
Although they are not part of box model but, they are very important for setting width and height of content
inside an element 
Another point is to notice that width and height do not include padding, border and margin.
